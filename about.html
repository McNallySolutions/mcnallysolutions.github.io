# About Me

Hi, I’m Kenneth McNally — a freelance software developer based in Trim, Ireland.  
I’ve worked in programming for over five years, originally trained in Germany, and I now help small businesses build simple, useful digital solutions.

After moving to Ireland with my wife and two kids, I started focusing on flexible, local projects — things that make business life easier: websites, automation, and tools that save time.

I enjoy projects where I can combine technical work with problem-solving — especially helping small companies go from “we only have Facebook” to “we have a proper online presence.”

When I’m not coding, I’m spending time with my family, exploring local spots, or improving small software side projects.
