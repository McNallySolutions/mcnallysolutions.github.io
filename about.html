 <h2>Hello, I’m Kenneth</h2>
    <p>
      I’m a freelance software developer based in Trim, Ireland. I started my career in Germany, where I completed an apprenticeship in programming and spent several years working on software solutions for businesses.
    </p>

    <p>
      I enjoy creating practical, lightweight software that helps people — whether that’s a small website for a local business or a simple tool that saves time in day-to-day work. My goal is always to make technology more approachable and genuinely useful.
    </p>

    <h3>Outside of Work</h3>
    <p>
      I live with my wife and two children and enjoy exploring Ireland, local playgrounds, and working on side projects in my spare time.
